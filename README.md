# Web3-Refund-by-Location-Smart-Contract

The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party,The employee’s phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met.

# Web3

Web3 contracts, also known as smart contracts, are crucial in today’s blockchain ecosystem. They enable users to interact online via the blockchain and the many dapps in the Web3 realm. Further, they set the conditions for decentralized transactions without needing a centralized third-party authority for verification. In other words, Web3 contracts govern the rules of any Web3 agreement. Given the importance of Web3 contracts, any aspiring blockchain developer or current Web3 user should understand these vital elements of the crypto realm in greater depth.
# Writing Web3 Smart Contracts

Do you have enough skill, or are you utilizing the proper Web3 tech stack to write smart contracts? To get started in blockchain development, you mainly need two programming languages: JavaScript and Solidity. Apart from these, you’ll need layers of programmable blockchains, nodes and node providers, development platforms, and APIs.

Today, people mostly use Solidity to write the majority of smart contracts for blockchains such as Ethereum. Moreover, Ethereum remains the most popular blockchain for Web3 contracts. Beginners who want to learn more about Ethereum may refer to the Moralis article on Ethereum development.

However, things are not as complicated as they seem. Even if you don’t know how to write Web3 contracts in Solidity, you can still build dapps on       Ethereum by relying on free tools such as OpenZeppelin to find a variety of smart contract templates and deploy them using Remix.

The space is innovating fast, and new ways to write and create Web3 contracts are emerging alongside new blockchains. Fortunately, Moralis allows greater flexibility by being cross-chain compatible from the start. As such, you can build cross-chain dapps that are instantly compatible with multiple Web3 blockchains using Moralis.

Powerful Web3 development platforms like Moralis can simplify your Web3 contract writing process. With Moralis, you can focus on JavaScript for blockchain development and use shortcuts to achieve the smart contract-driven features you want in your dapp. Moralis, the ultimate Web3 development platform, also provides you with tutorials and already written contracts for various use cases. Check the Moralis Web3 YouTube channel, Moralis’ blog, and Moralis’ documentation to access these resources.
